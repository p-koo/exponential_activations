    "In this notebook, we will generate synthetic sequences with implanted regulatory grammars, i.e. set of motifs.  Each regulatory grammar is defined by a set of motifs that are separated in space a specific distance.  In this simple dataset, only a single regulatory grammar is embedded within each sequence, which basically means that there is no useless motifs implanted, i.e. only sampling noise from the position weight matrices.  In addition, the start position of the regulatory grammar can be implanted in random locations on the seuqence, albeit the spacing between the motifs are conserved.  Details of the simulation procedure is outlined below."

    "We define a regulatory grammar, $G$, as a the interactions of specific motifs spaced in specific spatial positions. Each grammar consists of a position weight matrix (PWM) with implanted motifs from which a synthetic sequence is generated from.  In this synthetic dataset, each simulated sequence is generated from a given grammar that is randomly translated, but the motifs and spatial positions between motifs within the grammar are conserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate each regulatory grammar, we first create a model which consists of a subset of motifs and their spatial distances with respect to one another. We limit the pool of possible motifs to $M$ motifs to include all of the core motifs and a subset of motifs (num_motif total motifs) which are randomly sampled from the pool of JASPAR database (under the list tf_motifs).  For a given grammar, the number of motifs is determined by sampling an exponential distribution (parameterized by interaction_rate).  Then, the minimum is taken between this value and the max_motif, which imposes the constraint of a maximum number of motifs for a given grammar.  \n",

For simplicity, we will use a uniform distribution for the PWMs for all 'non-motif' nucleotides, i.e. $p = 1/4$.\n",
